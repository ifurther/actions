# GitHub Actions for Singularity

**under development**

This repository will provide GitHub Action for Singularity containers. 
Each action is a subdirectory here. For usage details, see the README file in
the respective directories.

## What do I see here?

 - [build](build) corresponds to a first effort to build a Singularity container directly from within GitHub Actions. See [this thread](https://twitter.com/vsoch/status/1072588623810322432) for why this isn't currently possible (but in the future might be?)
 - [registry](registry) on build and deploy of a container from a container repository, update a Static Singularity Registry with the record.
